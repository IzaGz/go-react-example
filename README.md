# go-react-example
Example project to show how to render React app on Golang server-side.  
It's very similar project like [andreypopp/react-quickstart](https://github.com/andreypopp/react-quickstart), but with Go and some key benefits.  

## Benefits & differences
First of all, you no need to use react-async. 


## Install

```bash
$ # clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/olebedev/go-react-example && cd $_
$ # fetch dependencies
$ go get ./...
$ # install binary
$ go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
```
Now you ready to start.
```bash
$ make
$ go run *.go
```
